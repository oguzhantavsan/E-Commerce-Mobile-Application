This project is an e-commerce project where men's and women's shoes are sold. This project consists of three development sections: backend, frontend, and mobile. In this project where we actively apply the scrum technique, which is an agile method, I took part in the mobile development section by using react-native and we developed mobile application for both IOS and Android platforms.
